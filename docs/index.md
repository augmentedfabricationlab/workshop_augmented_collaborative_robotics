# About

Digital fabrication technology, which allows for direct fabrication from design data, has the potential to revolutionize Archi-
tecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). However, due to the complexities of construction sites, including technical, 
social, and economic challenges, the AEC sector faces difficulties in fully adopting and integrating these innovations for au-
tomated, robotic building construction. The research discussed in this workshop explores a hybrid, human-robot fabrication 
approach as a potential paradigm shift. By integrating human involvement in design and fabrication workflows, this method
leverages machine capabilities while also engaging builders and fabricators.

In this workshop, part of [Future of Construction Symposium](https://futureofconstruction.net/), participants will participate in a human-robot assembly workflow where two collaborative robots place and
stabilize building components while humans assemble them. Utilizing a specialized mobile Augmented Reality interface that 
combines task management and robot control, humans and robots share a digital-physical workspace. This setup uses digi-
tal spatial data to facilitate cooperative assembly and aims to redefine the task distribution and coordination among humans, 
skilled workers, designers, machines, and robots.
