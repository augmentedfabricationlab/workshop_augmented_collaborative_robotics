The workshop bridges fundamental principles of geometric computing and design and leverage these insights to develop new algorithms and tools for 3D shape generation, simulation, structural design, and fabrication in design and engineering. At the interface of various scientific disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, civil engineering, architecture, and digital fabrication, participants are taught innovative computational design solutions for advanced manufacturing and construction at various scales.

The workshop covers the following topics:
* Introduction to the application of Computational Geometry and Computational Mechanics in Structural Design
* Introduction to the general theory of Fabrication-Aware Design
* Introduction to a specific selected computational architectural and structural design tool and fabrication technology
* Introduction to the processing of geometry, data structures, robot programming, and interfaces
* Domain-specific case studies with a practical design and fabrication task
